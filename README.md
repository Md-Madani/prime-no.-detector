A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself. In other words, a prime number cannot be formed by multiplying two smaller natural numbers.

## Key Points about Prime Numbers:

1. Greater than 1: The number must be greater than 1. The number 1 is not considered a prime number.

2. Divisibility: A prime number is divisible only by 1 and itself. It has exactly two distinct positive divisors.

3. Examples of Prime Numbers: The first few prime numbers are:

2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, and so on.

4. Even Prime: The only even prime number is 2. All other even numbers are divisible by 2, so they cannot be prime.

5. Composite Numbers: Numbers that are not prime are called composite numbers. These numbers have more than two divisors. For example, 4 (divisible by 1, 2, and 4) is a composite number.
   
## Why Are Prime Numbers Important?

1. Building Blocks of Numbers: Prime numbers are often referred to as the "building blocks" of all natural numbers. This is because every number greater than 1 can be factored into prime numbers (this is known as prime factorization). 
2. Cryptography: Prime numbers play a crucial role in modern cryptography, particularly in encryption algorithms like RSA, which secures data transmission over the internet.
